# blog front-end

My soul is tired from this lab. I learned React and Redux and cried the whole way. Actions didn't make sense at first, I'm not sure if they make sense now but my blog works (?) so I guess this is good enough. JK this was a fun project in which I learned a lot, but having a cold in conjunction to this project was not fun. Please have mercy on my soul. I think that doing this sick warrants some extra credit. Thank you so much and have fun blogging!! I'm still crying rn.

# Lab 5 Part II

I followed the lab instructions! Converting the frontend felt like mostly grunt work, but I had fun testing how the pages react differently with different permissions. My biggest struggle of this lab was inserting the NavBar, since I kept on getting an error about React elements only having one child. Turns out my bug was accidentally importing Router again in NavBar.

For future development, I'd like to add an error class, change each page even more based on whether a user is authenticated, make user profile pages, turn this app into something else, and more!!

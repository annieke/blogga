# blog front-end

My soul is tired from this lab. I learned React and Redux and cried the whole way. Actions didn't make sense at first, I'm not sure if they make sense now but my blog works (?) so I guess this is good enough. JK this was a fun project in which I learned a lot, but having a cold in conjunction to this project was not fun. Please have mercy on my soul. I think that doing this sick warrants some extra credit. Thank you so much and have fun blogging!! I'm still crying rn.
